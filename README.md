Password Keeper
=========

## Project Description

The purpose of the Password Kepper app is to provide companies or groups of people with a centralised location for their sites login credentials. Teams will find this tool useful to avoid writing passwords details on post-its for their colleague who might need it. The user just needs to log-in with their company credentials and they will have immediate access to all of the company's login details!
Password keeper was a mid-term project, created over the course of 6 days by Audrey Cooper, Keith Hong and Jaeyoung Kim. The backend was created with Express.js, the databse postgres, and the front end uses jQuery, Ajax and Sass.
